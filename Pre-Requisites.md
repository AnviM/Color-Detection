# Color-Detection
In this color detection Python project, we build an application through which we can automatically get the name of the color by clicking on specific area in the image. So for this, we will have a data file that contains the color name and its values-(Hex and R,G,B values) . Then we will calculate the distance from each color and find the shortest one. This is done using pandas and OpenCV.

For this project we use Pandas and OpenCV.
A prior knowledge of OpenCV will help in understanding the project better.
To install OpenCV in Anaconda :
1. Install Anaconda and required libraries. 
2. Open Anaconda Prompt.
3. Type the command : pip install opencv-python

OpenCV installed.

Now you may continue with the project.
